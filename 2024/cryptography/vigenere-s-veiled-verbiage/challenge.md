# Vigenère’s Veiled Verbiage

Punkte: **30**

The Vigenère Cipher, once considered unbreakable, represents a significant leap in cryptographic complexity from the Caesar Cipher. The Vigenère CIPHER uses a KEYWORD to encrypt the MESSAGE. Each letter in the KEYWORD shifts the corresponding letter in the PLAINTEXT. The KEY to this puzzle is a WORD. In this challenge, you must decrypt a MESSAGE encrypted with a KEYWORD. As future white hats, you are tasked with mastering both old and new techniques. Crack this cipher to demonstrate your evolving skills in the cryptographic arts!"
